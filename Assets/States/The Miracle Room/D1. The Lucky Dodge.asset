  storyText: 'Swift as lightning, Boon made a jump to the side right in time the
    boulder touched and smashed the ground. What a near death experience! Boon recovered
    just to witness the boulder had destroyed the brazier during its fall. But there
    was something glimmering near those rubbles.

    

    1. Examine the broken
    brazier.'
